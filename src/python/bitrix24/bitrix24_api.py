Module: bitrix24_api

This module provides the `Bitrix24API` class for interacting with the Bitrix24 API using a provided webhook URL.

The class allows for sending POST and GET requests to the Bitrix24 API, enabling interaction with various API methods.

Dependencies:
    requests: A library for making HTTP requests, which supports sending GET and POST requests and handling responses.

Classes:
    Bitrix24API: A class that interacts with the Bitrix24 API by sending POST and GET requests. It requires a webhook URL for initialization and provides methods for making API calls.

Usage Example:
    >>> from bitrix24_api import Bitrix24API

    >>> # Initialize a Bitrix24API object with a webhook URL
    >>> bitrix_api = Bitrix24API(webhook_url="https://your-webhook-url.com")

    >>> # Send a POST request to add a new task
    >>> post_response = bitrix_api.send_post_request("tasks.task.add", {"fields": {"TITLE": "New Task"}})

    >>> # Send a GET request to retrieve a task by its ID
    >>> get_response = bitrix_api.send_get_request("tasks.task.get", {"taskId": 123})

    >>> # Both responses will be of type requests.Response
